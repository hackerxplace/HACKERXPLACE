```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dharam-gfx/nookchat.git
cd nookchat
```

### Step 2: Install Server Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Client Dependencies

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

1. Create `.env` file in the server directory with:

```
# Server Environment Variables

SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Local development URL
# SERVER_URL=https://your-production-url.com  # Uncomment for production

```

### Client Configuration

The client is pre-configured to connect to the local server during development and a production server in production mode.

Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory with the following variables:

```
# Server URL - the base URL of your backend server
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=your_server_url

# API URL - optional external API URL if different from SERVER_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url

# Encryption key for chat messages (32 bytes = 256 bits)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key

# Google Gemini API key for AI features
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

For development, you can use `http://localhost:5000` as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. Start the server:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

2. In a new terminal, start the client:

```bash
cd client

```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Mode

1. Build the client:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

2. Start the client:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
cd ../server
npm start
```

## AI Features

NookChat integrates multiple AI-powered features to enhance the user experience:

### Reply Suggestions

NookChat offers intelligent reply suggestions powered by the Gemini AI API:

- **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI analyzes the received message to generate relevant reply suggestions
- **Quick Replies**: Users can select from suggested responses with a single click
- **Horizontal Scrollable Interface**: Browse through multiple suggestions in a clean, pill-based design
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab and Enter keys to select suggestions for accessibility
- **Fallback Suggestions**: Default suggestions provided even if the AI service is unavailable
- **Privacy-First Design**: Message context is processed temporarily and not stored permanently

#### How It Works

1. When a message is received, the AI suggestion component appears above the chat input
2. The component makes an API call to `/api/ai/suggestions` with the message content
3. The Gemini AI model generates contextually appropriate responses
4. Users can select a suggestion or dismiss the suggestions panel
5. The feature gracefully degrades if AI services are unavailable

### Text Rewriting

NookChat includes an AI-powered text rewriting feature:

- **Multiple Style Options**: Rewrite text to be formal, casual, friendly, or professional
- **Real-time Processing**: Quick rewriting using Google's Gemini AI API
- **Error Handling**: Returns original text if the AI service is unavailable
- **Seamless Integration**: Accessible directly from the chat interface

#### API Integration

The AI features are implemented through dedicated API endpoints:
- `/api/ai/suggestions` - Generates contextual reply suggestions
- `/api/ai/rewrite` - Rewrites text in different styles

#### Configuration

AI features can be:
- Enabled/disabled in user settings
- Customized for response style (formal, casual, professional)
- Adjusted for privacy preferences

## Testing

NookChat uses Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run client tests
cd client
npm test

# Run tests with watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

The test suite is organized into categories:

```
__tests__/
├── components/         # UI component tests
│   ├── Footer.test.tsx
│   ├── ModeToggle.test.tsx
│   └── ...
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks tests
│   ├── useNotificationSound.test.ts
│   └── ...
└── utils/              # Utility functions tests
    ├── dateUtils.test.tsx
    └── ...
```

Mock implementations are provided for files and styles to ensure proper test isolation.
